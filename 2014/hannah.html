<h1>Hannah and The Twelve-Disk Tower of Hanoi</h1>



<h2>Prologue</h2>

Hannah was faced with a puzzle known as the Tower of Hanoi.<p>
The puzzle consisted of three tall pegs side-by-side,
and a stack of twelve disks threaded through the left peg.
<p>
The twelve disks were successively smaller from bottom to top, and each was colored differently.
The first, bottom-most, and largest disk was colored red;
the next disk was colored orange;
the next disk was colored brown;
the next, fourth, disk was colored yellow;
the next disk was colored chartreuse;
the next, sixth, disk was colored green;
the next, seventh, disk was colored teal;
the next disk was colored blue;
the next, ninth, disk was colored purple;
the next, tenth, disk was colored magenta;
the next disk was colored maroon;
and the twelfth, smallest, and top-most disk was colored white.
<p>
What Hannah needed to do to solve the puzzle was to move one disk at a time from the top
of a stack on one peg to another peg, never placing a disk on top of a smaller disk,
so that all twelve disks ended up on the right peg.
